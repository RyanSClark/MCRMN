    <h5><b> The defination of cancer</b></h5>
   <p>Cancer is a condition in which some cells in the body grow out of control and spread to other parts of the body.
   Cancer can begin practically anywhere in the trillions of cells that make up the human body. Human cells normally expand and multiply (via a process known as cell division) to generate new cells as needed by the body. Cells die as they become old or injured, and new cells replace them.
   Sometimes this orderly process breaks down, and abnormal or damaged cells grow and multiply when they shouldn’t. These cells may form tumors, which are lumps of tissue. Tumors can be cancerous or not cancerous (benign). 
   Cancerous tumours can infect adjacent tissues and spread to other parts of the body, resulting in the formation of new tumours (a process called metastasis). Malignant tumours are another name for cancerous tumours. Many malignancies, including leukemias, create solid tumours, whereas cancers of the blood do not.
   Benign tumours do not penetrate or spread into neighbouring tissues. Benign tumours rarely reappear after being excised, although malignant tumours do. However, benign tumours can grow to be extremely enormous. Some, such as benign brain tumours, can produce serious symptoms or even be fatal.

<!--Type-->
<h5>Types of cancer</h5>
<p>There are more than 200 different types of cancer, and each is diagnosed and treated in a particular way. Doctors divide cancer into types based on where it begins. Four main types of cancer are:</p>
  <ul><section id="Carcinomas">
    <p><b>1. Carcinomas:</b> Carcinomas are the most common type of cancer. They are formed by epithelial cells, which are the cells that cover the inside and outside surfaces of the body. There are many types of epithelial cells, which often have a column-like shape when viewed under a microscope.

      Carcinomas that begin in different epithelial cell types have specific names:
      
      Adenocarcinoma is a cancer that forms in epithelial cells that produce fluids or mucus. Tissues with this type of epithelial cell are sometimes called glandular tissues. Most cancers of the breast, colon, and prostate are adenocarcinomas.
      
      Basal cell carcinoma is a cancer that begins in the lower or basal (base) layer of the epidermis, which is a person’s outer layer of skin.
      
      Squamous cell carcinoma is a cancer that forms in squamous cells, which are epithelial cells that lie just beneath the outer surface of the skin. Squamous cells also line many other organs, including the stomach, intestines, lungs, bladder, and kidneys. Squamous cells look flat, like fish scales, when viewed under a microscope. Squamous cell carcinomas are sometimes called epidermoid carcinomas.
      
      Transitional cell carcinoma is a cancer that forms in a type of epithelial tissue called transitional epithelium, or urothelium. This tissue, which is made up of many layers of epithelial cells that can get bigger and smaller, is found in the linings of the bladder, ureters, and part of the kidneys (renal pelvis), and a few other organs. Some cancers of the bladder, ureters, and kidneys are transitional cell carcinomas.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section id="Sarcomas">
    <p><b>2. Sarcomas: </b>Sarcomas are cancers that form in bone and soft tissues, including muscle, fat, blood vessels, lymph vessels, and fibrous tissue (such as tendons and ligaments).
      Osteosarcoma is the most common cancer of bone. The most common types of soft tissue sarcoma are leiomyosarcoma, Kaposi sarcoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, liposarcoma, and dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section id="Leukemias">
    <p><b>3. Leukemias: </b>Cancers that begin in the blood-forming tissue of the bone marrow are called leukemias. These cancers do not form solid tumors. Instead, large numbers of abnormal white blood cells (leukemia cells and leukemic blast cells) build up in the blood and bone marrow, crowding out normal blood cells. The low level of normal blood cells can make it harder for the body to get oxygen to its tissues, control bleeding, or fight infections.
      There are four common types of leukemia, which are grouped based on how quickly the disease gets worse (acute or chronic) and on the type of blood cell the cancer starts in (lymphoblastic or myeloid). Acute forms of leukemia grow quickly and chronic forms grow more slowly.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section id="Lymphomas">
    <p><b>3. Lymphomas: </b>Lymphoma is cancer that begins in lymphocytes (T cells or B cells). These are disease-fighting white blood cells that are part of the immune system. In lymphoma, abnormal lymphocytes build up in lymph nodes and lymph vessels, as well as in other organs of the body.
      There are two main types of lymphoma:
      Hodgkin lymphoma – People with this disease have abnormal lymphocytes that are called Reed-Sternberg cells. These cells usually form from B cells.
      Non-Hodgkin lymphoma – This is a large group of cancers that start in lymphocytes. The cancers can grow quickly or slowly and can form from B cells or T cells.</p>
  </section>
</ul>

<p>You are more likely to get cancer as you get older. In fact, age is the biggest risk factor for the disease. More than nine out of 10 cancers are diagnosed in people 45 and older. Seniors older than 74 make up almost 28% of all new cancer cases.</p>
  <p>Researchers are not sure why this is so. It could be that the passing decades give your cells more time to turn faulty, or mutate, and grow into cancer. Or older age simply means you have been exposed to sunlight, cigarette smoke, chemicals, and other cancer-causing agents for longer.</p>

<p>An estimated 1.81 million people in the U.S. are expected to be diagnosed with cancer in 2020. About 606,000 people are expected to die from any type of cancer. Cancer death rates have improved steadily since the early 1990s.</p>
  <p>About four out of 10 Americans will have cancer at some point in their lifetime.</p>

<br>

<!--How-->
<h5>How does cancer develop?</h5>
<p>Cancer is a genetic disease—that is, it is caused by changes to genes that control the way our cells function, especially how they grow and divide.</p>
<p>Genetic changes that cause cancer can happen because:</p>
<li>of errors that occur as cells divide. </li>
<li>of damage to DNA caused by harmful substances in the environment, such as the chemicals in tobacco smoke and ultraviolet rays from the sun. </li>
<li>they were inherited from our parents.
  <p>The body normally eliminates cells with damaged DNA before they turn cancerous. But the body’s ability to do so goes down as we age. This is part of the reason why there is a higher risk of cancer later in life.</p>
  <p>Each person’s cancer has a unique combination of genetic changes. As the cancer continues to grow, additional changes will occur. Even within the same tumor, different cells may have different genetic changes.</p>
</li>

<br>
<!--Causes-->
<h5>Types of Genes that Cause Cancer</h5>
<br>
<div class="conainer grid">
  <div><p>
  The genetic changes that contribute to cancer tend to affect three main types of genes—proto-oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and DNA repair genes. These changes are sometimes called “drivers” of cancer. </p>
  <p> Proto-oncogenes are involved in normal cell growth and division. However, when these genes are altered in certain ways or are more active than normal, they may become cancer-causing genes (or   oncogenes), allowing cells to grow and survive when they should not. </p>
  <p>Tumor suppressor genes are also involved in controlling cell growth and division. Cells with certain alterations in tumor suppressor genes may divide in an uncontrolled manner.
  DNA repair genes are involved in fixing damaged DNA. Cells with mutations in these genes tend to develop additional mutations in other genes and changes in their chromosomes, such as duplications and deletions of chromosome parts. Together, these mutations may cause the cells to become cancerous.</p>
  <p>As scientists have learned more about the molecular changes that lead to cancer, they have found that certain mutations commonly occur in many types of cancer. Now there are many cancer treatments available that target gene mutations found in cancer. A few of these treatments can be used by anyone with a cancer that has the targeted mutation, no matter where the cancer started growing.</p>

<!--when spreads-->
<h5>When Cancer spreads</h5>
<p>A cancer that has spread from the place where it first formed to another place in the body is called metastatic cancer. The process by which cancer cells spread to other parts of the body is called metastasis.</p>
<p>Metastatic cancer has the same name and the same type of cancer cells as the original, or primary, cancer. For example, breast cancer that forms a metastatic tumor in the lung is metastatic breast cancer, not lung cancer.</p>
<p>Under a microscope, metastatic cancer cells generally look the same as cells of the original cancer. Moreover, metastatic cancer cells and cells of the original cancer usually have some molecular features in common, such as the presence of specific chromosome changes.</p>
<p>In some cases, treatment may help prolong the lives of people with metastatic cancer. In other cases, the primary goal of treatment for metastatic cancer is to control the growth of the cancer or to relieve symptoms it is causing. Metastatic tumors can cause severe damage to how the body functions, and most people who die of cancer die of metastatic disease.  </p>

<br>
<!--Diagnosis-->
<section id="Diagnosis">
<h5>Diagnosing Cancer</h5>
<p>Often, a diagnosis begins when a person visits a doctor about an unusual symptom. The doctor will talk with the person about his or her medical history and symptoms. Then the doctor will do various tests to find out the cause of these symptoms.
  But many people with cancer have no symptoms. For these people, cancer is diagnosed during a medical test for another issue or condition.
  Sometimes a doctor finds cancer after a screening test in an otherwise healthy person. Examples of screening tests include colonoscopy, mammography, and a Pap test. A person may need more tests to confirm or disprove the result of the screening test.
  For most cancers, a biopsy is the only way to make a definite diagnosis. A biopsy is the removal of a small amount of tissue for further study. Learn more about making a diagnosis after a biopsy.</p>
  <p>For a few cancers, studies show that screening tests can save lives by diagnosing cancer early. For other cancers, screening tests are recommended only for people with increased risk.
    A variety of medical organizations and patient-advocacy groups have recommendations and guidelines for cancer screening. Review the various guidelines with your doctor and together you can determine what's best for you based on your own risk factors for cancer.</p>
    <p>
      Your doctor may use one or more approaches to diagnose cancer: 
      <br>
      <u><b> Physical exam:</b></u> Your doctor may feel areas of your body for lumps that may indicate cancer. During a physical exam, your doctor may look for abnormalities, such as changes in skin color or enlargement of an organ, that may indicate the presence of cancer.
      <br>
      <u><b>Laboratory tests: </b></u>Laboratory tests, such as urine and blood tests, may help your doctor identify abnormalities that can be caused by cancer. For instance, in people with leukemia, a common blood test called complete blood count may reveal an unusual number or type of white blood cells.
      <br>
      <u> <b>Imaging tests: </b></u>Imaging tests allow your doctor to examine your bones and internal organs in a noninvasive way. Imaging tests used in diagnosing cancer may include a computerized tomography (CT) scan, bone scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET) scan, ultrasound and X-ray, among others.
      <br>
      <u> <b>Biopsy:</b></u> During a biopsy, your doctor collects a sample of cells for testing in the laboratory. There are several ways of collecting a sample. Which biopsy procedure is right for you depends on your type of cancer and its location. In most situations, a biopsy is the only way to definitively diagnose cancer.
      <br>
     <p>
      In the laboratory, doctors look at cell samples under the microscope. Normal cells look uniform, with similar sizes and orderly organization. Cancer cells look less orderly, with varying sizes and without apparent organization.
    </p>
    </p>
</section>

<!--Stages-->
<section id="Stages">
  <h5>Stages of Cancer</h5>
  <p>Staging is a way to describe a cancer. The cancer's stage tells you where a cancer is located and its size, how far it has grown into nearby tissues, and if it has spread to nearby lymph nodes or other parts of the body. Before starting any cancer treatment, doctors may use physical exams, imaging scans, and other tests to determine a cancer's stage. Staging may not be completed until all the tests are finished.</p>
  <p>Staging helps your doctor plan the best treatment. This may include choosing a type of surgery and whether or not to use chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Knowing the cancer stage lets your entire health care team talk about your diagnosis in the same way.</p>
  <p>Doctors can also use staging to:</p>
  <li>Understand the chance that the cancer will come back or spread after the original treatment.</li>
  <li>Help forecast the prognosis, which is the chance of recovery</li>
  <li>Help determine which cancer clinical trials may be open to you.</li>
  <li>See how well a treatment worked</li>
  <li>Compare how well new treatments work among large groups of people with the same diagnosis</li>
